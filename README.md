# TSD Google Analytics Guide
This repository supports the "Technology Solutions Division's (TSD) Google Analytics Guidance for all digital services" GitHub pages site.


### Google Analytics First
All Digital Services that are developed or maintained by the TSD division will leverage Google Analytics from the beginning. This is a firm requirement and should be included in the requirements of all projects.


### Account and Property Structure
Much of this guidance focuses around the consolidation of Google Analytics accounts. As our division matures in it's usage of Google Analytics, we have noticed how quickly management of the Google Analytics accounts get out of control. In order to better manage this, we provide the following rules.


1. All Internal to GSA/FAS Digital Services will use a consolidated "TSD" google Analytics Account.
2. External Digital Services, unless otherwise directed, will be placed under the A Google Account for the Business Line, or Integrator that sponsors the Digital Service.
3. Each Digital Service, should have a single "Property" under that Account. 
4. Development and Test environments should use the same property, but views should be constructed to segment the data.



### Common Framework
All TSD Division websites will leverage the [Google Analytics on Steroids](https://github.com/CardinalPath/gas) framework.

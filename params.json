This is a firm requirement and should be included in the requirements of all projects. This means that each project must understand how this framework affects them and make the appropriate preparations to ensure that once deployed, the digital service is integrated with Google Analytics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Account and Property Structure\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nAs our division matures in it's usage of Google Analytics, we have noticed how quickly management of the Google Analytics accounts get out of hand. In order to better manage this, we provide the following rules based upon [guidance from Google](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009618?hl=en):\r\n\r\n\r\n1. All Internal to GSA/FAS Digital Services will use a consolidated \"TSD\" Google Analytics Account.\r\n2. External Digital Services, unless otherwise directed, will be placed under the Google Analytics Account for the Business Line, or Integrator that sponsors the Digital Service. (For example: Common Acquisition Platform, Integrated Technology Service, Customer Accounts & Research).\r\n3. Each Digital Service, should have a single \"Property\" or \"Tracking Code\" under that Account. \r\n4. Development and Test environments should use the same property and views should be constructed to segment the data.\r\n\r\n![Image](/assets/ga-account-structure.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Every Page and View Should be Tracked\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nModern web applications blur the line between web pages and web applications. At a bare minimum, every \"page\" or unique URL must include the appropriate Google Analytics Tracking framework or code. This is an important concept as not adhering to this will cause \"holes\" in your analytics which could lead to poor business decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Google Analytics Frameworks\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle Analytics tracks webpages in a standard way. However, the TSD division supports multiple web development technologies like; AngularJS, struts II, Django, Drupal, and Coldfusion. Each technology serves content in a different way, which may not lend itself to the standard way that Google Analytics tracks. In order to help teams worry less about customizing their Google Analytics implementation to work for their application, the TSD division has standardized various Google Analytics 3rd party and open source frameworks that should be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Drupal\r\nWhen leveraging Drupal for your digital service, you should be using the standard [Drupal Google Analytics Module](https://github.com/CardinalPath/gas).\r\n\r\n#### AngularJS\r\nAngularJS is a phenominal web application framework that obscures the lines between traditional websites and web-applications. Encapsulating everything into API requests, It can deliver an entire web application in a single web page. This provides phenomenal value to the users, but can create challenges when attempting to track what users are using.\r\n\r\nTo combat this, your application should use [Angulartics](http://luisfarzati.github.io/angulartics/) or [Angularytics](https://github.com/mgonto/angularytics).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### All Others\r\nThe United States Digital Service (USDS) Digital Analytics Program (DAP) has standardized their implementation of Google Analytics using [Google Analytics on Steroids (GAS)](https://github.com/CardinalPath/gas). If the other frameworks do not apply, the GAS framework should be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### DAP Support\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nIn support of the USDS DAP program, all TSD digital services should be implementing the [USDS DAP](http://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/) tracking code on all websites. This is an additional tracking code in support of the DAP program.\r\n\r\n**NOTE: DAP does note replace  the TSD Division Google Analytics**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Event Tracking\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nAll digital services should be configured to track the following events using [Event Tracking](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/events):\r\n\r\n\r\n1. File Downloads\r\n2. Form Submissions\r\n3. Opening pop-up, modal, or other type of \"sub\" window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Referral Spamming\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nReferrer spam occurs when your website gets fake referral traffic from spam bots and this fake traffic is recorded by your Google Analytics. There is no silver bullet for stopping referral spamming and therefore, as part of the TSD Google Analytics Framework, we provide some basic configuration changes as well as a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for detecting and blocking referral spam.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Production view Google Analytics Bot Filtering\r\nAll Production views should be configured to use Google Analytics Bot Filtering. This can be accomplished by going to Admin -> View Settings, clicking the \"Exclude all hits from known bots and spiders\" checkbox, and saving. \r\n\r\n\r\n![Image](/assets/ga-bot-filtering.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Account level filter for most common spam referrers\r\nAll Google Analytics accounts should have an account level filter for the most basic bot spammers. Thanks to research done by other groups, we have settled upon the list provided by [analytics-toolkit.com](http://blog.analytics-toolkit.com/2015/guide-referrer-spam-google-analytics/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\tdarodar\\.|semalt\\.|buttons-for.*?website|blackhatworth|ilovevitaly|prodvigator|cenokos\\.|ranksonic\\.|adcash\\.|share.?buttons\\.|social.?buttons\\.|hulfingtonpost\\.|free.*traffic|buy-cheap-online|-seo|seo-|videos-for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe filter should be constructed as shown below:\r\n\r\n![Image](/assets/ga-bot-filtering2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### .htaccess referral blacklist (Apache Servers Only)\r\nOne of the best ways to prevent spammers is to stop them at the source. When providing a Digital Service using an Apache webserver, this is best accomplished through modifying the root .htaccess file. As part of the TSD Google Analtyics Framework, all Apache based webservers should modify its root .htaccess file and implement the \"Ultimate Referral Blacklist\".\r\n\r\n\r\n[Referral Blacklist](/assets/ultimate-referrer-blacklist.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**References:**\r\n\r\n1. [Ultimate Referrer Blacklist](https://perishablepress.com/blacklist/ultimate-referrer-blacklist.txt)\r\n2. [Brassblogs .htaccess spam filter](http://brassblogs.com/blog/htaccess-and-spam)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Monthly Referral Spam Standard Operating Procedure.\r\nEach month, the Google Analytics administrator for the property, should go into the production views standard reporting and run the Acquisition -> Overview -> All Traffic -> Referrals report. If any website exist that are not already in your referrer blacklist or account level filter, they should be added. Please post an issue to this repository, and we will be happy to add your finding to the list!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Ghost Spamming\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike direct referral spamming, ghost spamming is where a bot will use your tracking code against you without ever touching your site. Understanding that Google Analytics does not include an authentication protocol, we have determined that the easiest and most effective method of combating ghost spamming is through Hostname Filtering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Hostname Filtering\r\nBy Configuring Hostname filtering on your Google Analytics views, you have a quick and effective way of preventing indirect spammers. Aside from your \"All Website Data\" view, all views should have a hostname filter setup to only capture hits from the hostname of the Digital Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-34215789-11","note":"Don't delete this file!
